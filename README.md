## Welcome to the Static Web!
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/temp.techpines.com/asset-rack-white.png">

The Static Web is amazing.  The Static Web is blisteringly fast.  The Static Web is ultra efficient.
Get started with asset-rack.  It will change your life. :)  The rest of the docs are in javascript, this one example is in coffeescript for beauty's sake.

```coffeescript
rack = require 'asset-rack'
assets = new rack.Rack [
    new rack.StaticAssetBuilder
        baseUrl: '/static'
        dirname: "#{__dirname}/static"
    new rack.LessAsset
        url: '/style.css'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/style/base.less"
    new rack.BrowserifyAsset
        url: '/app.js'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/client/app.coffee"
    new rack.JadeAsset
        url: '/templates.js'
        dirname: "#{__dirname}/templates"
    new rack.JadeEntryPages
        routes: routes
]
```

## What is the Static Web?

The Static-Web is a modern, high-performance, cutting edge take on the most prolific platform.

## What is an Asset?

> __An asset is an unchanging resource on the web.  It has the following three features:__

1. __Location (URL)__: Where on the web the resource is located.
2. __Contents (HTTP Response Body)__: The body of the response received by a web client.
3. __Meta Data (HTTP Headers)__: Gives information about the resource, like content-type, caching info.

## Getting Started

Asset-rack is the most advanced static-web framework on any platform.

```js
rack = require('asset-rack')
asset = new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt'
    contents: 'hello world'
})
```

Now that you have your asset you might want to use it.  That is easy enough, just hook it up to express.

```
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt'
    contents: 'hello world'
})
```

What's cool is that this new asset is available both here:

```
/hello-238jf202390fj40.txt
```

What if you have multiple assets?

```js
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt',
    contents: 'hello world',
})
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello-again.txt',
    contents: 'hello world again',
})
```

Or we can use an asset rack, which is an object that holds them all:

```js
assets = new rack.AssetRack([
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello.txt',
        contents: 'hello world',
    }),
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello-again.txt',
        contents: 'hello world again',
    })
])
app.use assets
```

You are probably thinking that this is very simple, and you're right.  How about a more complex example.

```js
assets = new rack.AssetRack([
    new rack.StaticAssetBuilder
        urlPrefix: '/static'
        dirname: "#{__dirname}/static"
    new rack.LessAsset
        url: '/style.css'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/style/base.less"
    new rack.BrowserifyAsset
        url: '/app.js'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/client/app.coffee"
])
```

# Deploying to the Cloud
A static-web framework needs be deployed.  The deploy mechanism is extremely sophisticated.

## Amazon S3

```js
assets.deploy({
    provider: 'amazon',
    container: 'some-bucket',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```

## Rackspace Cloud Files
```js
assets.deploy(
    provider: 'rackspace',
    container: 'some-cloud-folder',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```

## Azure
```js
assets.deploy(
    provider: 'azure',
    container: 'some-cloud-folder',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```


Or you can create your own assets:

```js
MyCoolAsset = rack.Asset.extends({
    create: function(option) {
        
        // create your asset

        // Once you have the contents of your asset.
        // It is ready to fly.
        this.emit('created', {contents: contents})
    }
})
```

# Examples

I have been using this framework for over a year on client projects.  Here are some examples that I can actually show you though!
