## Welcome to the Static Web!
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/temp.techpines.com/asset-rack-white.png">

The Static Web is amazing.  The Static Web is blisteringly fast.  The Static Web is ultra efficient.
Get started with asset-rack.  It will change your life. :)  The rest of the docs are in javascript, this one example is in coffeescript for beauty's sake.

```coffeescript
rack = require 'asset-rack'
```

The Static-Web is a modern, high-performance, cutting edge take on the most prolific platform.

## What is an Asset?

> __An asset is a resource on the web that has the following three features:__

1. __Location (URL)__: Where on the web the resource is located.
2. __Contents (HTTP Response Body)__: The body of the response received by a web client.
3. __Meta Data (HTTP Headers)__: Gives information about the resource, like content-type, caching info.

Conceptually, this definition is the bedrock foundation of __asset-rack__.

## Getting Started

Asset-rack is the most advanced static-web framework on any platform.

```js
asset = new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt'
    contents: 'hello world'
})
```

Need to serve your assets with a blisteringly fast in memory cache using express?  Try this:

```
app.use(asset)
```

What's cool is that this new asset is available both here:

```
/hello-238jf202390fj40.txt
```

What if you have lots of complex assets that depend on one another?  Is there a hero to save us?

Try using a rack!

```js
assets = new rack.AssetRack([
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello.txt',
        contents: 'hello world',
    }),
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello-again.txt',
        contents: 'hello world again',
    })
])
```

# Batteries Included

The above assets are simple to say the least, but we have some professional grade assets included.



Here is our complete list of assets currently available:

#### For Stylesheets
* [Less]() - Compile less assets, ability to use dependencies, gzip, minification.
* [Stylus]() - Compile stylu assets, ability to use dependencies, gzip, minification.

#### For your javascript
* [Browserify]() - Create browserify assets that allow you to use "node-style" requires on the client-side.
* [Snockets]() - Create snockets assets, to get the node-flavor of the "sprockets" from rails.

### Templates
* [Jade]() - High, performance jade templates precompiled for the browser.
* [AngularTemplates]() - AngularJS templates for you AngularJS folks.

#### Other
* [StaticAssets]() - Images(png, jpg, gif), fonts, whatever you got.

# Deploying to the Cloud
A static-web framework needs be deployed.  The deploy mechanism is extremely sophisticated.

## Amazon S3

```js
assets.deploy({
    provider: 'amazon',
    container: 'some-bucket',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```

## Rackspace Cloud Files
```js
assets.deploy(
    provider: 'rackspace',
    container: 'some-cloud-folder',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```

## Azure
```js
assets.deploy(
    provider: 'azure',
    container: 'some-cloud-folder',
    key: '<AWS ACCESS KEY>',
    secret: '<AWS SECRET KEY>',
}, function(error, config) {})
```


Or you can create your own assets:

```js
MyCoolAsset = rack.Asset.extends({
    create: function(option) {
        
        // create your asset

        // Once you have the contents of your asset.
        // It is ready to fly.
        this.emit('created', {contents: contents})
    }
})
```

Do you have a cool asset that you would like to share.  Send a pull request, and I'll add it to the list.

# Examples

I have been using this framework for over a year on client projects.  Here are some examples that I can actually show you though!

We open sourced the code for our business site:
