# Install

```js
npm install asset-rack
```

# Getting Started

Asset-rack is the most advanced asset management framework on any platform.  It embarrasses the Ruby Asset Pipeline.

```js
rack = require('asset-rack')
asset = new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt'
    contents: 'hello world'
})
```

Now that you have your asset you might want to use it.  That is easy enough, just hook it up to express.

```
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt'
    contents: 'hello world'
})
```

What's cool is that this new asset is available both here:

```
/hello-238jf202390fj40.txt
```

What if we are in production mode and we only want to allow the hash url version:

```js
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt',
    contents: 'hello world',
    hash: true
})
```

What if you have multiple assets?

```js
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello.txt',
    contents: 'hello world',
})
app.use(new rack.Asset({
    url: '/hello-again.txt',
    contents: 'hello world again',
})
```

Or we can use an asset rack, which is an object that holds them all:

```js
assets = new rack.AssetRack([
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello.txt',
        contents: 'hello world',
    }),
    new rack.Asset({
        url: '/hello-again.txt',
        contents: 'hello world again',
    })
])
app.use assets
```

You are probably thinking that this is very simple, and you're right.  How about a more complex example.

```js
assets = new rack.AssetRack([
    new rack.StaticAssetBuilder
        urlPrefix: '/static'
        dirname: "#{__dirname}/static"
    new rack.LessAsset
        url: '/style.css'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/style/base.less"
    new rack.BrowserifyAsset
        url: '/app.js'
        filename: "#{__dirname}/client/app.coffee"
])
```

Well this is cool, now you all of you assets properly hashed and ready to serve.  Or if you are into the static web hosting game.  You might try this:

```
assets.deployS3()
```

Or you can create your own assets:

```js
MyCoolAsset = rack.Asset.extends({
    create: function(option) {
        
        // create your asset

        // Once you have the contents of your asset.
        // It is ready to fly.
        this.emit('created', {contents: contents})
    }
})
```
