# AssetsLite

Dynamic asset handling that is better than [connect-assets](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/connect-assets).

## Features

1. Supports both javascript and coffeescript.
2. Uses browserify requires, which let's you do requires node-style.
3. You can require jade templates from your javascript/coffeescript code.
4. Md5 sum always attached to files for caching and CDN usage.
5. No writing built files to disk, ever.
6. Support for less.
7. Can be plugged in as connect middleware.
8. Easily extensible.

## Install

```bash
npm install git://github.com/techpines/assets-lite.git
```

## Setup

```javascript
express = require('express');
assetsLite = require('assets-lite');

setup = function(next) {
    assetsLite.create([
        new assetsLite.LessAsset({
            filename: __dirname + '/style/app.less',
            url: '/style.css'
        }),
        new assetsLite.BrowerifyAsset({
            filename: __dirname + '/client/app.js',
            url: '/app.js'
        })
    ], next);
};

setup(function() {
    app = express.createServer();
    app.configure(function() {
        app.use(assetsLite());
    })
    app.listen(8000)
});
```

### Options

## Markup Function

In your server side jade template, include the jade runtime scripts provided and specify a client side template to load:

```
!= assetsTag('/style.css');
!= assetsTag('/app.js');
```

This will result in the following html code:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style-91c65beadfc6440e3e9f35dc2b366f98.css"></link>
<script src="/app-39efeec2cb92f3ad7c9ba8b38f3acd77.js"></script>
```
